## Creating a New Release

This section documents the process for creating and publishing a new tagged release of the anytype-go SDK.

### Release Process

1. **Determine the new version number**

   Following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), determine the new version based on the changes since the last release:
   - MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
   - MINOR version for backward-compatible new functionality
   - PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes
   - For pre-release versions, append `-alpha.X`, `-beta.X`, etc.

2. **Check the current version and latest tag**

   ```bash
   # Check the current version in the code
   grep "Version =" pkg/anytype/version.go
   
   # List all existing tags
   git tag -l
   
   # Check changes since the last tag
   git log LAST_TAG..HEAD --oneline
   ```

3. **Update version in the codebase**

   Edit the version number in `pkg/anytype/version.go` to match the new version you've determined:

   ```go
   Version = "X.Y.Z-alpha.N"  // Replace with your new version
   ```

4. **Commit the version changes**

   ```bash
   git add pkg/anytype/version.go CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release vX.Y.Z-alpha.N"
   ```

5. **Create and push the release tag**

   ```bash
   # Create an annotated tag
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z-alpha.N -m "Release vX.Y.Z-alpha.N"
   
   # Push the tag to the remote repository
   git push origin vX.Y.Z-alpha.N
   ```

### Example: Creating v0.2.0-alpha.2

For example, here's how we created the v0.2.0-alpha.2 release:

1. We determined that a minor version bump was appropriate due to new features
2. We checked the latest tag (v0.1.0-alpha.1) and reviewed changes since then
3. We updated the version in pkg/anytype/version.go from "0.2.0-alpha" to "0.2.0-alpha.2"
4. We created a CHANGELOG.md documenting all changes since v0.1.0-alpha.1
5. We committed these changes with "chore: prepare release v0.2.0-alpha.2"
6. We created and pushed a new tag: "v0.2.0-alpha.2"
